# Developer API
Say the Spire comes with an API that allows other mods to interact with it. This is currently in very early stages so a lot of the functionality isn't yet exposed and it may not be obvious how to fully use it.

To access the API, import `sayTheSpire.SayTheSpire`. More detailed information will be posted here later, but see the SayTheSpire.java file for more information on the functions that have been added so far.
