# Important Notes

## Achievement Enabler and Game Leaderboards
When the game is launched in a modded state, achievements and daily run
leaderboard submissions are disabled by default. There unfortunately is nothing
I can do about this within the scope of this mod. Achievements can be reenabled
however using the achievement enabler mod. Install this from the following
locations:

* [Achievement Enabler Steam
  Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1692554109)
* there is currently no GitHub repository for this mod.

## Cloud Saves
When the game is launched via ModTheSpire using the mts_steam.cmd file, it does
not run all of the usual Steam functions that would be run if the game was
launched normally. As a result, your game data is not automatically backed up to
the Steam Cloud. To fix this, run the game normally and select the option to
upload your data. You will need OCR to do this unfortunately and there is no way
to automatically back up the data periodically. You can copy the json files from
the game directory to manually back up your saves as an alternative.

## Settings not Saving
There is a bug related to Game Settings not saving when using Mod the Spire.
This seems to be an issue with Steam and the game itself.
