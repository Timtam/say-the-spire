# Say the Spire

A mod for the game Slay the Spire to provide blind accessibility. this is a template readme I hastily threw together that will resemble the final readme.

* This only works on Windows for now
* Only controllers are supported; keyboard support is coming soon.

## Mod Installation and Usage

For installation and usage instructions for users, go [here](../users.md).

For developers, go [here](../devs.md).

## Known Issues

* daily climb (leaderboard section doesn't read), input settings, and credits screens do not read. These are being worked on.
* Certain text (such as the character select text screen's title) doesn't automatically read. This is being worked on.
* Required controller inputs are not read/viewable. This is being worked on.
* The UI can jump between cards a few times (for example when retaining cards as the silent). this isn't an issue I can fix and does not break the game in any way.
* Currently certain text is only read in English (for example UI element types).
* Not all UI positions read as you would expect (for example potions and relics don't have position information). This is being worked on
